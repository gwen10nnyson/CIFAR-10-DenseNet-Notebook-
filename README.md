This repository contains the deep learning code for improving the accuracy of CIFAR-10 dataset. 
I have been able to reach 87% with predefined keras densenet121 model.
Many functionalities such as learning rate scheduler, image augmentation, normalisation, regularisation etc have been played around with.
SGD optimiser has been used for improving accuracy.

Any better results for this dataset with predefined keras model are welcome.
